Two of them are `Actual(MU)` and `Excess(+) / Shortfall (-)`. `Actual(MU)` represents the actual power generation. `Excess(+) / Shortfall (-)` tells is that generated power is excess or shortfall for that particular day of a power station. You have to find out what should be the actual power generation required for that day by the power stations that there would not be any excess or shorfall power. For the result, make a new column.\n",
